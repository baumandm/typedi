# ES Decorators Conformance Tests

This folder comprises of a test suite which ensures the package is compatible with the ES Decorators 
standard, a (as of now) [Stage 3 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) which replaces
the legacy "experimentalDecorators" functionality provided by TypeScript.
