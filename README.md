# `@typed-inject/injector`

Elegant Dependency Injection in JavaScript and TypeScript.

[**Early documentation available now!**](https://64a0c6b5de74517c4c7bdb77--singular-praline-356e00.netlify.app/)

**This is a fork of [the original TypeDI](https://github.com/typestack/typedi)**.
Quite a lot has changed in this fork. To name a few changes and additions:

- **Resolution constraints**: `Optional`, `SkipSelf`, `Self`, `Many`.  This is very much copied from Angular: you can use them to change the strategy used for resolving a certain dependency of a service.
- Removal of property injection (which is a real anti-pattern) and parameter injection; removed as it isn't a feature in the official decorator spec; therefore, it's at a strong risk of being removed -- see https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/50439.  It's been removed with a more sensible API that has the exact same functionality.
- **Proper container inheritance** through `of` and `ofChild` (and an API for creating containers with no parent)
- **Easier use in JavaScript** through the `JSService` function, without any manual calls to `Container.set` required.
- **ESM bundles** (comes in at 7.9kB for the curious) alongside UMD.
- `getOrNull` and `getManyOrNull` methods for resolving identifiers (alongside the former error-throwing APIs)
- No more passing containers into services unexpectedly and causing runtime errors (re: https://github.com/typestack/typedi/issues/571)
- Investigating disabling eager services by default (see https://github.com/freshgum-bubbles/typedi/pull/17); though they can easily be re-enabled through a method call.
- An experimental [**tree visitor API**](https://github.com/freshgum-bubbles/typedi/blob/7004e81cec5152bff75fd4529e29e1f87541bbc1/src/interfaces/tree-visitor.interface.ts) (see https://github.com/freshgum-bubbles/typedi/pull/14) which allows you to traverse containers, child containers, and their respective services from a single visitor object.
- A new work-in-progress documentation website: https://github.com/freshgum-bubbles/typedi/pull/19
- Proposed API change that disables eager services by default for easier testing: https://github.com/freshgum-bubbles/typedi/pull/17
- Addition of a `Container.setValue` method that makes it easier to set string & Token keys: https://github.com/freshgum-bubbles/typedi/pull/30
- `HostContainer`, to allow services to get the container they're running under: https://github.com/freshgum-bubbles/typedi/pull/26
- Lazy references to services, through `LazyReference`, to replace the old function-based API
- Type-checking for dependencies of services, WIP: https://github.com/freshgum-bubbles/typedi/issues/32
- A more strict testing suite to prevent regressions in API functionality, partly helped by https://github.com/freshgum-bubbles/typedi/pull/31
- An actively maintained project ðŸ˜‰

## Example

As a quick example, let's consider the `LogService` from the documentation website.

In TypeDI, we'd implement it like so:

```ts
import { Service } from '@typed-inject/injector';

@Service([ ])
export class LogService {
    public log (message: string) {
        console.log(message);
    }
}

@Service([LogService])
export class RootService {
    public constructor (private logger: LogService) { }

    run () {
        this.logger.log('Hello World!');
    }
}

const rootService = Container.get(RootService);
rootService.run();
```
