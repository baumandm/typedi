TypeDI is a [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) tool for TypeScript and JavaScript. With it you can build well-structured and easily testable applications in Node or in the browser.

Main features includes:

- constructor based injection
- singleton and transient services
- support for multiple DI containers
